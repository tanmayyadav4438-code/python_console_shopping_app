Project Vision Statement: Python E-Commerce Console App (v1.0)

Mission

To provide a foundational, transparent, and easy-to-understand console application that accurately simulates the core mechanics of an e-commerce platform, specifically focusing on inventory management, shopping cart aggregation, and the transaction process.

Core Objectives

Educational Clarity: Serve as an accessible example of fundamental Python programming concepts, including dictionaries, function definition, and control flow, within a practical business context.

Accuracy in Simulation: Ensure the simulated stock and cart logic precisely reflects real-world constraints (e.g., preventing overselling, accurate price calculation).

User Experience (CLI): Maintain a clear, guided, and error-tolerant command-line interface to ensure intuitive operation for any user.

Future Direction

While the initial version is designed for a single session and in-memory data, the future of this project will involve implementing persistence layers (saving data) and extending functionality to support basic user authentication and potentially a graphical interface.
